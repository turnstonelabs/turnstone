    Subscribes to :meth:`SessionManager.subscribe_to_state` and listens
    for ``WorkstreamState.IDLE``.  If the workstream's
    :class:`NudgeQueue` is non-empty, dispatches via
    ``session_worker.send`` with a no-op ``enqueue`` callback.

    **Race semantics.**  ``session_worker.send`` decides atomically
    under ``ws._lock`` whether a worker thread already owns the
    workstream.  Three outcomes:

    * No worker → spawn a new daemon that calls
      :meth:`ChatSession.deliver_wake_nudge_from_queue` (the wake
      drains its own queue and runs the synthetic empty-user turn).
    * Worker running → call our ``enqueue`` lambda, which is a no-op.
      The wake is silently dropped; the queued nudge stays in
      ``NudgeQueue`` and the in-flight worker picks it up at its next
      user-message-attach or tool-result seam (whichever fires first
      for the entry's channel).  This is the load-bearing fallback —
      we never spawn a competing worker.
    * Workstream gone (``ws is None``) or session not built
      (``ws.session is None``) → bail.

    **Subscription order matters.**  When a workstream-kind-specific
    observer (e.g. ``CoordinatorIdleObserver`` in PR 3) needs to
    *enqueue* a nudge on the same IDLE event before this watcher
    *peeks* the queue, the observer must register first so that
    ``SessionManager.set_state``'s subscriber loop fires it earlier in
    the same synchronous fan-out.

    **Kind-agnostic.**  Fires for any workstream regardless of
    :class:`WorkstreamKind`.  Producers decide what to enqueue.
